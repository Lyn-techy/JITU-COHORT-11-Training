        <h4>Question 1</h4>
        <p>What is the difference between state and props?</p>
        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
              <th>STATE</th>
              <th>PROPS</th> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>The data is passed within the component only.</td>
              <td>The data is passed from one component to another.</td>
              
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>It is mutable(can be modified).</td>
              <td>It is immutable(cannot be modified).</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>State can be used only with the state components/class components.</td>
                <td>Props can be used with state and functional components.</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>State is both read and write.</td>
                <td>Props are read only.</td> 
            </tr>

        <h4>Question 2</h4>
        <p>With the following code blocks, can you say what will happen in each of these instances?</p>
        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <p>For literal datatypes (such as number and strings), the variable contains the value, and <br>
            that cannot change. This is the case with the first two case scenarios. With JS objects,as is the case with the last case scenario, <br>
            the variable is essentially a reference , which cannot change, however values within the object that is refers to can.
        </p>

        <h4>Question 3</h4>
        <p>Outline the various stages of the React.js lifecycle</p>
        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Mounting</li>
            <p>It means putting elements into the DOM.</p>
        
            <li>Updating</li>
            <p>The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.</p>
            <p>A component is updated whenever there is a change in the components <bold>state</bold> or <bold>props</bold></p>

            <li>Unmounting</li>
            <p>The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM.</p>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Question 4</h4>
        <p>How are controlled and uncontrolled components different?</p>
        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. Whereas, <br>
                in uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                Usage of component State is a must for controlled components. Use of state is completely <br>
                optional for uncontrolled components, but one must use Refs in it.
            </li>
            <li>
                In controlled component, the form input elements values and mutations are totally driven by <br>
                event handlers and value of the input element is always inferred from the state. <br>
                In uncontrolled components, they don't use any states on input elements or any event handler.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Question 5</h4>
        <p>Explain what three dots mean in React.</p>
        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <p>These three dots are called the spread operator. The spread operator allows you to deconstruct an aray or <br>
        object into separate variables.</p>
